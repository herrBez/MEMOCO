\section{Usage}
In this section the usage of the programs are briefly described.
See section \ref{sec:Gerber} for the generation of instances from files in gerber format.
Details about the usage of the instance generator can be found in section \ref{sec:instance:generator}.
\paragraph{First Assignment}
In order to compile the first assignment a \verb|Makefile| is provided.
After the compilation the file \verb|main| is created. It needs an instance
in \verb|.dat| file format, in which the first line contains $N$, and the 
remaining $N$ contains $N$ entries in which the entry $i$, $j$ represent the distance
from drill point $i$ to drill point $j$.
\begin{verbatim}
./main <tsp_instance.dat> [OPT]
\end{verbatim}
In order to view the available options you can use the \verb|--help|  option.
The only option that is worth it to mention here is the \verb|--benchmark| option that
suppress useless messages and format the output, so that the \verb|benchmark.sh| can write
the information in a text file that can be plotted using \verb|gnuplot|.
